# Mars Weather API Enhancement

## Overview
This document describes the enhancements made to the Mars Weather functionality to include detailed data from the NASA InSight Weather API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Model Enhancement (`MarsWeather.swift`)

#### New Nested Data Structures
Created four new structures to represent detailed weather data:

**TemperatureData**
- `average: Double` - Average temperature
- `minimum: Double` - Minimum temperature
- `maximum: Double` - Maximum temperature
- `count: Int` - Number of temperature samples

**PressureData**
- `average: Double` - Average atmospheric pressure
- `minimum: Double` - Minimum pressure
- `maximum: Double` - Maximum pressure
- `count: Int` - Number of pressure samples

**WindSpeedData**
- `average: Double` - Average wind speed
- `minimum: Double` - Minimum wind speed
- `maximum: Double` - Maximum wind speed
- `count: Int` - Number of wind speed samples

**WindDirectionPoint**
- `compassDegrees: Double` - Direction in degrees (0-360)
- `compassPoint: String` - Compass direction (N, NNE, NE, etc.)
- `compassRight: Double` - X-component of direction vector
- `compassUp: Double` - Y-component of direction vector
- `count: Int` - Number of observations in this direction

**WindDirectionData**
- `mostCommon: WindDirectionPoint?` - Most frequently observed wind direction
- `directions: [WindDirectionPoint]` - List of all observed directions

#### Enhanced MarsWeather Model
The main `MarsWeather` struct now includes:

**New Fields:**
- `firstUTC: String` - Start of observation period (UTC timestamp)
- `lastUTC: String` - End of observation period (UTC timestamp)
- `temperature: TemperatureData` - Detailed temperature information
- `pressure: PressureData` - Detailed pressure information
- `windSpeed: WindSpeedData` - Detailed wind speed information
- `windDirection: WindDirectionData?` - Wind direction data (optional)
- `northernSeason: String` - Season in Mars northern hemisphere
- `southernSeason: String` - Season in Mars southern hemisphere
- `monthOrdinal: Int` - Mars month number (1-12)

**Backward Compatibility Properties:**
Computed properties provide backward compatibility with existing code:
- `var minTemp: Int` - Derived from temperature.minimum
- `var maxTemp: Int` - Derived from temperature.maximum
- `var averageTemp: Int` - Derived from temperature.average
- `var averagePressure: Int` - Derived from pressure.average
- `var averageWindSpeed: Int` - Derived from windSpeed.average

### 2. Service Layer Enhancement (`InSightService.swift`)

Updated `parseMarsWeatherData()` method to extract all detailed fields from the API response:

- Extracts temperature data from `AT` object (average, min, max, count)
- Extracts pressure data from `PRE` object (average, min, max, count)
- Extracts wind speed data from `HWS` object (average, min, max, count)
- Extracts wind direction from `WD` object (most common direction with compass data)
- Extracts seasonal information (Season, Northern_season, Southern_season, Month_ordinal)
- Extracts UTC timestamps (First_UTC, Last_UTC)

### 3. UI Enhancement (`MarsView.swift`)

Completely redesigned the weather display to show all detailed information:

**New UI Sections:**

1. **Header Section**
   - Sol number and Earth date
   - Season badge with Mars month

2. **Seasonal Information**
   - Northern hemisphere season (blue text)
   - Southern hemisphere season (orange text)

3. **Temperature Section**
   - Minimum, Average, and Maximum temperatures
   - Sample count
   - Visual hierarchy with average highlighted in blue

4. **Pressure Section**
   - Minimum, Average, and Maximum atmospheric pressure
   - Sample count
   - Values displayed in Pascals (Pa)

5. **Wind Speed Section**
   - Minimum, Average, and Maximum wind speeds
   - Sample count
   - Values displayed in m/s with one decimal precision

6. **Wind Direction Section** (when available)
   - Most common wind direction (compass point)
   - Direction in degrees
   - Number of observations

7. **Observation Period**
   - Start and end times (UTC)
   - Formatted as HH:MM UTC

**Helper Function:**
- `formatUTCTime()` - Converts full UTC timestamp to readable time format

### 4. Sample Data Update

Updated all sample data entries to include realistic detailed values:
- Temperature ranges from -15°C to -98°C (min/max)
- Pressure ranges from 720 to 772 Pa (min/max)
- Wind speeds from 0.9 to 24.1 m/s (min/max)
- Sample counts reflect realistic observation numbers (170K+ for temperature, 880K+ for pressure, 87K+ for wind)
- Wind directions include most common directions (W, WNW, NW)
- All entries show "fall" season with "early winter" (north) and "early summer" (south)

### 5. Test Updates

Updated all test files to work with the new data structure:

**MarsWeatherTests.swift:**
- Updated initialization tests to use new structure
- Added tests for new data structures (TemperatureData, PressureData, WindSpeedData)
- Added tests for seasonal data completeness
- Added tests for UTC timestamps
- Added tests for wind direction data
- Added tests for backward compatibility properties

**InSightServiceTests.swift:**
- Updated parsing tests to verify extraction of all detailed fields
- Added comprehensive test with real API data structure (sol 675)
- Updated tests to check temperature, pressure, wind speed, and wind direction parsing

**MarsViewTests.swift:**
- Updated property access tests to use new convenience properties
- Added validation for new seasonal information fields

## API Response Structure

The implementation now correctly handles the NASA InSight Weather API response structure:

```json
{
  "675": {
    "AT": {
      "av": -62.314,     // Average temperature (°C)
      "mn": -96.872,     // Minimum temperature (°C)
      "mx": -15.908,     // Maximum temperature (°C)
      "ct": 177556       // Sample count
    },
    "First_UTC": "2020-10-19T18:32:20Z",
    "Last_UTC": "2020-10-20T19:11:55Z",
    "HWS": {
      "av": 7.233,       // Average wind speed (m/s)
      "mn": 1.051,       // Minimum wind speed (m/s)
      "mx": 22.455,      // Maximum wind speed (m/s)
      "ct": 88628        // Sample count
    },
    "Month_ordinal": 10,
    "Northern_season": "early winter",
    "PRE": {
      "av": 750.563,     // Average pressure (Pa)
      "mn": 722.0901,    // Minimum pressure (Pa)
      "mx": 768.791,     // Maximum pressure (Pa)
      "ct": 887776       // Sample count
    },
    "Season": "fall",
    "Southern_season": "early summer",
    "WD": {
      "most_common": {
        "compass_degrees": 292.5,
        "compass_point": "WNW",
        "compass_right": -0.923879532511,
        "compass_up": 0.382683432365,
        "ct": 30283
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Data Display**: Users now see complete weather statistics including min/max/average values
2. **Scientific Accuracy**: Sample counts provide context for data reliability
3. **Hemispheric Information**: Both northern and southern hemisphere seasons displayed
4. **Wind Direction**: Most common wind direction with detailed compass data
5. **Temporal Context**: UTC timestamps show the observation period for each sol
6. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work via convenience properties
7. **Well-Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Parse and display all wind direction data (not just most common)
- Add graphs/charts for temperature and pressure trends
- Display data quality indicators based on sample counts
- Add unit conversion options (Celsius/Fahrenheit, Pa/mbar)
- Historical comparison across multiple sols
- Weather alerts for extreme conditions
