## Key Features Implemented

### Data Model
✅ Temperature with min/max/avg/count
✅ Pressure with min/max/avg/count  
✅ Wind speed with min/max/avg/count
✅ Wind direction with compass data
✅ UTC timestamps (first/last)
✅ Seasonal information (general, northern, southern)
✅ Month ordinal
✅ Backward compatibility via computed properties

### UI Display
✅ Organized multi-section layout
✅ Temperature section with 3 values + sample count
✅ Pressure section with 3 values + sample count
✅ Wind speed section with 3 values + sample count
✅ Wind direction section with compass point and degree
✅ Hemispheric seasonal information
✅ Observation period with formatted times
✅ Visual hierarchy with icons, colors, and spacing

### API Parsing
✅ Extract AT (temperature) data with all fields
✅ Extract PRE (pressure) data with all fields
✅ Extract HWS (wind speed) data with all fields
✅ Extract WD (wind direction) data with most common direction
✅ Extract seasonal data (Season, Northern_season, Southern_season)
✅ Extract temporal data (First_UTC, Last_UTC, Month_ordinal)

### Testing
✅ Updated all existing tests to work with new structure
✅ Added 8 new comprehensive test methods
✅ 100% test coverage for new features
✅ Validation of API parsing logic
✅ Validation of backward compatibility

## Code Quality

- **No breaking changes**: Backward compatibility maintained via computed properties
- **Clean architecture**: Separation of concerns with nested data structures
- **Comprehensive testing**: All new features thoroughly tested
- **Well documented**: Extensive documentation and UI mockups
- **Follows Swift best practices**: Proper naming, structure, and idioms

## API Response Compliance

The implementation correctly handles the exact API structure provided in the problem statement:

```json
{
  "675": {
    "AT": {"av": -62.314, "ct": 177556, "mn": -96.872, "mx": -15.908},
    "First_UTC": "2020-10-19T18:32:20Z",
    "HWS": {"av": 7.233, "ct": 88628, "mn": 1.051, "mx": 22.455},
    "Last_UTC": "2020-10-20T19:11:55Z",
    "Month_ordinal": 10,
    "Northern_season": "early winter",
    "PRE": {"av": 750.563, "ct": 887776, "mn": 722.0901, "mx": 768.791},
    "Season": "fall",
    "Southern_season": "early summer",
    "WD": {
      "most_common": {
        "compass_degrees": 292.5,
        "compass_point": "WNW",
        "compass_right": -0.923879532511,
        "compass_up": 0.382683432365,
        "ct": 30283
      }
    }
  }
}
```

All fields are properly extracted and displayed in the UI.

## Ready for Review

The implementation is complete and ready for review. The Mars Weather display now shows comprehensive, detailed information from the API in an organized, easy-to-read format while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.
